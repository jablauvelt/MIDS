JAB Rating Below Average, Survey Ratings Above Average	37

The above table gives a rough overview of how the ratings I created (JAB Ratings) compare to the ratings given in the survey
table. The table shows that my ratings and patient ratings are not very well correlated, because 2,116 hospitals have different
correlations and only 920 match correlations. A correlation match is defined as when both my ratings and patient ratings are
above average, or when both are below average. Such an instance would imply that there is some consistency between the two
ratings. However, if my rating is above average, for example, and the patient ratings are below average, then it seems like
there is some disagreement between the two ratings. Since there are many more providers that my ratings and patient
ratings don't agree on than ones we do agree on, I conclude that there is not much correlation between the two sets of 
correlations.
